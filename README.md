# Python-Labs 🐍🧪

Heyy! This is a collection of all the Python fun and mini-projects I once had scattered across separate repositories — now brought together in one place. 

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- **Pygame_Lab/** 🎮  
  Mini-games and experiments with **Pygame** — learning game development one project at a time.  

- **Python_Mania/** ⚡  
  Random scripts & short-term projects — my *detox-zone* for stress-busting coding sprints.  

- **Python_Reset/** 🔄  
  A revisit to **Python fundamentals** — refreshing syntax, problem-solving, and keeping my basics sharp.

## ✨ Why This Exists  
Not every project needs to be “big.”  
This repo is my **sandbox** — a place to experiment, reset, and just have fun with Python.
