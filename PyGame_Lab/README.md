# PyGameLab

Once upon a boring spring, with a week‚Äôs holiday and an empty hostel‚Ä¶  
I decided to pick up a new hobby ‚Äî that‚Äôs when I tried my hands on **Pygame**.  
It was fun if nothing else, and I‚Äôll be catching on soon! INDEED!!

## üïπÔ∏è What‚Äôs Inside?  
A bunch of mini-games I built while learning Pygame.  
Some are cool, some are broken ‚Äî all are part of the journey!  

- **DotDash** ‚Üí Moving shapes & basic controls 
- **BrickBreaker** ‚Üí Collision detection & paddle logic 
- **BouncingBall** ‚Üí Multi-directional controls (needs fixing!)  
- **RunToTheEdge** ‚Üí Sprite sheets & restart mechanics  
- **FlappyBall** ‚Üí Gravity, jump physics & win conditions
