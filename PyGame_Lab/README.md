# PyGameLab
Just having fun with Pygame! ðŸŽ® Learning by building one small game at a time â€” some might be cool, some might be lame, but all are part of the journey.

Below is a brief description of each project along with key takeaways from the development process.

--------------------------------------------------------

### 1. DotDash
**Description:**

A simple game where a circle moves across the screen using the WASD keys. The game introduces basic movement mechanics.

**What I Learned:**
- How to draw objects (like circles) on the screen using Pygame.
- How to display text on the screen.

**Preview:**

### 2. BrickBreaker
**Description:**

A classic brick-breaking game where a player-controlled paddle bounces a ball to break bricks.

**What I Learned:**
- The difference between shape objects (pygame.draw.rect()) and placeholders- for positioning & collision detection (pygame.Rect()).
- How to implement collision detection and control object movement using logic.

**Preview:**

### 3. BouncingBall
**Description:**

A visualization game with four paddles and a bouncing ball. The left and right paddles are controlled using W/S and Up/Down keys, while the top and bottom paddles are controlled using A/D and Left/Right keys. The game stops when the ball escapes the screen.

**What I Learned:**
- Attempted to extend knowledge from the BrickBreaker game.
- The complexity of multi-directional controls made the game difficult to manage.
- This game needs fixing to improve playability.
- Learned how to detect win condition and how to implement a game restart feature.

### 4. RunToTheEdge
**Description:**

A game where a sprite character moves left and right using arrow keys to reach the other end of the screen.

**What I Learned:**
- How to use sprite sheets in Pygame.
- How to create text that changes size dynamically, simulating a GIF effect.
- Implemented a game restart feature.

**Preview:**

### 5. Flappy Ball
**Description:**

A simple physics-based game where a ball falls due to gravity and jumps when the spacebar is pressed. The goal is to reach the top of the screen to win. If successful, the game displays a "You Win!" message and restarts after 10 seconds.

**What I Learned:**
- How to apply gravity and jump mechanics in Pygame.
- How to display a win message dynamically.
